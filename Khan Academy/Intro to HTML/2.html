        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</em><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein</strong> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare</strong> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk.</strong><br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing</strong> is just another word for <em>growing.</em> And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning.</strong><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet.</em><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on <em>basic ideas</em> that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can <em>learn</em> anything.</strong>
